# Contributing

`musdb` is designed as scientific software. Therefore, we encourage the community to submit bug-fixes and comments and improve the __computational performance__, __reproducibility__ and the __readability__ of the code where possible. When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make in the issue tracker with the owners of this repository before making a change.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

The preferred way to contribute to musdb is to fork the 
[main repository](http://github.com/sigsep/sigsep-mus-db/) on
GitHub:

1. Fork the [project repository](http://github.com/sigsep/sigsep-mus-db):
   click on the 'Fork' button near the top of the page. This creates
   a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub server.

2. Clone this copy to your local disk:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/sigsep-mus-db.git
$ cd musdb
```

3. Create a branch to hold your changes:

```
$ git checkout -b my-feature
```

   and start making changes. Never work in the ``master`` branch!

4. Ensure any install or build artifacts are removed before making the pull request.

5. Update the README.md and/or the appropriate document in the `/docs` folder with details of changes  to the interface, this includes new command line arguments, dataset description or command line examples.

6. Work on this copy on your computer using Git to do the version
   control. When you're done editing, do:

```
$ git add modified_files
$ git commit
```

   to record your changes in Git, then push them to GitHub with:

```
$ git push -u origin my-feature
```

Finally, go to the web page of your fork of the musdb repo,
and click 'Pull request' to send your changes to the maintainers for
review. This will send an email to the committers.

(If any of the above seems like magic to you, then look up the 
[Git documentation](http://git-scm.com/documentation) on the web.)
